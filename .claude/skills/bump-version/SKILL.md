description: Bump the sprig version and refresh the changelog. Determines the next version from the LAST GIT TAG (not the csproj value, which can drift), bumps src/Sprig.App/Sprig.App.csproj, backfills changelog sections for any tagged versions that were never documented, summarises every change since the last tag into a new CHANGELOG.md section (keeping the dry humour), clears the Unreleased section, and prints the new version plus its changelog entries. Use when the user says "bump version", "bump the version", "/bump-version", or wants to cut a new release entry.

# Bump Version

Bumps sprig to the next patch version and brings `CHANGELOG.md` up to date.

## Why the tag, not the csproj

The version in `src/Sprig.App/Sprig.App.csproj` and the `[Unreleased]` changelog section both
drift — sometimes a version gets tagged without the csproj or changelog catching up. The
**last git tag is the source of truth**. Always derive the next version from it.

## Steps

### 1. Gather everything in one batch

Run this single block first — it collects the tag, the next version, the new commits, and
the dates for any backfill, so you don't make repeated round-trips:

```bash
LAST_TAG=$(git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -1)
echo "LAST_TAG=$LAST_TAG"
echo "=== all tags (oldest→newest) ==="; git tag --sort=v:refname
echo "=== new commits on HEAD since $LAST_TAG ==="
git log $LAST_TAG..HEAD --no-merges --date=short --pretty=format:'%h %ad %s'
```

Parse `LAST_TAG` as `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. The next version is the same with **PATCH + 1**
(e.g. `v0.1.0` → `v0.1.1`). Call it `$NEXT` (csproj wants it without the `v`, e.g. `0.1.1`).
If there are no tags at all, fall back to the csproj `<Version>` and bump that, and say so.

**Scope is `HEAD`, deliberately.** Only commits reachable from `HEAD` are releasing. Do **not**
use `--all` — it drags in unmerged worktree/branch WIP that isn't shipping, which is both
wrong and slow. If you know specific work landed on another branch that *is* part of this
release, add that branch explicitly; otherwise stay on `HEAD`.

Most commit subjects are self-explanatory — summarise straight from them. Only `git show
<hash>` a commit when its subject is genuinely opaque (e.g. "tweaks", "first pass"). Skip
noise entirely: stash entries (`WIP on…`, `index on…`), pure-WIP commits, and plumbing a user
would never notice. Collapse related commits into the single *net* change they add up to
(see "What to write" in step 4).

### 2. Bump the csproj

Edit the `<Version>` element in `src/Sprig.App/Sprig.App.csproj` to `$NEXT` (no `v` prefix).
Leave everything else untouched — set it to `$NEXT` regardless of its current value.

### 3. Backfill any missing tagged versions

A version can be tagged without ever getting a changelog section. From the tag list in step 1,
find tags with **no** matching `## [v…]` heading in `CHANGELOG.md`. For each missing tag
(oldest first), get its commits and date in one call, scoped to that tag's range:

```bash
# fill in <prev_tag> and <tag>; --date=short on the last line gives the heading date
git log <prev_tag>..<tag> --no-merges --date=short --pretty=format:'%h %ad %s'; \
  git log -1 --format='HEADING_DATE=%cd' --date=short <tag>
```

Insert each backfilled `## [v<tag>] - YYYY-MM-DD` (using its own tag date, not today) in the
correct reverse-chronological slot, applying the same summarising and dry-humour rules below.
Do every missing tag, not just the latest.

> Concrete example: tag `v0.1.1` exists but the changelog's newest section is `v0.1.0` — so
> `v0.1.1` needs backfilling from `v0.1.0..v0.1.1` before the new version goes on top.

### 4. Rewrite the changelog

In `CHANGELOG.md`:

- **Create a new section** directly under `## [Unreleased]`, titled
  `## [v$NEXT] - YYYY-MM-DD` using today's date.
- Fill it with the summarised, user-facing bullets from step 1. **Fold in** anything already
  sitting in the `[Unreleased]` section — those changes are part of this release.
- **Clear the `[Unreleased]` section** so it sits empty (keep the `## [Unreleased]` heading
  and the `---` separators; just remove its bullets).
- Preserve the existing file format exactly: heading style, the `---` separators, and the
  reverse-chronological order (newest version on top).

#### What to write

- **Write for the end user, not the developer.** Describe what changed for someone *using*
  sprig. Mention implementation details only when they genuinely matter to the user
  (e.g. "existing settings carry over"). Internal refactors, file moves, and plumbing don't
  get a bullet at all.
- **Keep bullets snappy — this is the rule that gets ignored most, so enforce it hard.** Aim
  for a short phrase, roughly ten words or fewer; one line, never two. Cut "now", "the ability
  to", "you can now". Drop the trailing "so you can…" / "so you know…" rationale — the change
  speaks for itself; keep an aside only when it earns the dry humour. Prefer "Configurable
  port range" over "The port range is now configurable so you can change where ports come
  from". After drafting, reread every bullet and shorten any that runs long.
- **Describe the cumulative change, not the commit trail.** A version's section is the net
  difference from the previous version — the end state, not the journey. If a feature was
  added, then fixed, then tweaked across several commits, that's *one* bullet describing the
  finished feature. Never list intra-version fixes to something that didn't exist in the last
  release; the user never saw the broken version.

#### Tone — keep the dry humour

The changelog has a deadpan, self-aware voice. Match it. Write straight bullets for ordinary
changes; reserve the parenthetical asides and dry understatement for the moments that earn
them. Don't force a joke into every line — the humour lands because most lines are plain.
Never invent changes that didn't happen for the sake of a punchline.

### 5. Report back

Print, plainly:

- The next version number (e.g. `v0.1.1`).
- The exact changelog entries you wrote for that version.
- If you backfilled any missing tagged versions, list which ones and show their entries too.

## Notes

- This skill does **not** commit, tag, or push — it only edits the two files and reports.
- Releases are cut by **pushing a `v*` tag**, which triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  (Velopack build → GitHub Release). So the flow is: run this skill, commit the two files, then
  tag `v$NEXT` and push the tag when you're ready to release.
- Only the patch component is bumped. If the user wants a minor/major bump, they'll say so —
  follow their instruction instead of auto-incrementing patch.
