.SYNOPSIS
    Installs Sprig on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
    Downloads the Velopack installer (Sprig-win-Setup.exe) for a GitHub release, verifies it against
    the SHA256SUMS.txt published alongside it, and runs it. Everything after this - every subsequent
    update - is in-app: open Sprig, go to About -> Check for updates.

    Designed to be run as a one-liner:

        irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArcticGizmo/sprig/main/install.ps1 | iex

    Nothing here tags a download with the mark-of-the-web (that's a browser's doing), so this route skips
    the "Windows protected your PC" SmartScreen dialog the same download through a browser walks into.

    KEEP THIS FILE PURE ASCII. It has no byte-order mark, so Windows PowerShell 5.1 decodes it as the
    system codepage (Windows-1252 here) rather than UTF-8. A UTF-8 em dash then arrives as three 1252
    characters ending in 0x94 = U+201D, a curly closing quote - and PowerShell honours curly quotes as
    string delimiters, so one em dash inside a normal "..." string silently terminates it early and the
    rest of the script mis-parses. tools/test-install.ps1 asserts the file stays ASCII.

.PARAMETER Version
    Install a specific version (e.g. 0.4.0) instead of the latest release. A leading "v" is fine.
    Also reads $env:SPRIG_VERSION, which is how you pin through the piped one-liner:
        $env:SPRIG_VERSION = '0.4.0'; irm .../install.ps1 | iex

.PARAMETER Repo
    owner/name of the GitHub repository to install from. Defaults to ArcticGizmo/sprig; override for
    a fork. Also reads $env:SPRIG_REPO.

.EXAMPLE

    # Pin a version, passing real parameters (needs the script as a scriptblock, not a pipe into iex):
